    "Built a server from scratch and deployed a customized home server infrastructure to meet diverse household needs such as website hosting, data backup and Iot integration.",
  issues:
    "Despite having multiple financial apps like Maybank and others, I kept running into the same issue: I couldn’t manage my money the way I wanted. These tools were either unintuitive, lacked customization, or failed to provide the insights I needed. I couldn’t easily track spending by store, set dynamic budgets, or visualize where my money was going in a way that helped me stay accountable.",
  solutionsHeader:
    "So I built my own home server—completely from scratch. It’s tailored specifically for the way I work and live, giving me a centralized, always-on platform to run everything I need, exactly how I want it.",
  solutionsList: [
    "Host custom productivity tools without monthly fees or feature limitations",
    "Keep backups of all critical data using RAID 10 and version control systems like Git",
    "Deploy and manage apps in containers using Docker, LXC, and Portainer",
    "Use NGINX and Cloudflare services to access everything remotely, securely, and fast",
    "Maintain full ownership and control over my infrastructure—no third parties, no black boxes",
  ],
  solutionsConclusion:
    "Now, whether I need to access my notes, deploy a new app, or check in on important files during an emergency, it’s all just a few clicks away. No clutter, no delays—just a streamlined system built around reliability, privacy, and peace of mind.",
