## 📌 Why I Built This

While digital resumes and static PDFs serve their purpose, they often fall short in showcasing technical depth, real-time updates, and interactivity. I realized my traditional resume lacked flexibility and didn’t truly reflect the way I work or what I’ve built.

This portfolio solves that by offering:

- A dynamic and interactive format for showcasing my professional journey
- A centralized place to explore my experience, skills, and technical projects
- Mobile and print-friendly formats to adapt across various platforms
- Continuous updates via CI/CD pipelines and global hosting via Cloudflare Pages
